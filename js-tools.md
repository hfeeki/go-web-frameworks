Javascript Frameworks
=====================
## [DanielRapp](https://github.com/DanielRapp/fragment.js.git)
	A tiny tool for easily loading html fragments and templates

## [mustache.js](https://github.com/janl/mustache.js.git)
	Minimal templating with {{mustaches}} in JavaScript 

## [handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/)	
	Handlebars provides the power necessary to let you build semantic templates effectively with no frustration.
	Mustache templates are compatible with Handlebars, so you can take a Mustache template, import it into Handlebars, and start taking advantage of the extra Handlebars features.

## [Backbone.js](http://www.csser.com/tools/backbone/backbone.js.html)
	https://github.com/documentcloud/backbone.git
	Give your JS App some Backbone with Models, Views, Collections, and Events

## [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/)
	RequireJS is a JavaScript file and module loader. It is optimized for in-browser use, but it can be used in other JavaScript environments, like Rhino and Node. Using a modular script loader like RequireJS will improve the speed and quality of your code.
